## Copying Programs:

(recommended) With CLI >> If you want extra credit you can learn how to install git cli and use git clone to copy the code into the file in a faster and more convenient way. There are git tutorials on this site and also on youtube. 

Without CLI >> To run this code you'll need to set up all the files with the same names then copy paste to each.

## Running Discord Bot

You'll need to install pip onto your system. Search for pip tutorial on youtube. Then in the terminal run:
pip intall discord

Once you get that installed you'll have to set up a discord bot for yourself. Go to 
https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true 
and set up a new discord bot with some basic messaging permissions. Make sure you copy the new token to replace mine in the bot.py file. Invite the bot to your server and then run the python file for it to join and start talking with you. Again... youtube is a great resourse for this stuff.
